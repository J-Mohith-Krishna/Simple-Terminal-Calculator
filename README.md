# Simple-Terminal-Calculator
## What's this Repository all about?
  This repository hosts a simple 'Terminal-based calculator' featuring fundamental functions. The program has been designed to provide a basic calculator experience within the standard Terminal environment.
## Why this Repository?
  While developing a Terminal-based calculator may seem like a basic programming project with limited practical applications, its primary purpose is to serve as a demonstration of a programming language's versatility. Building and interacting with such a program not only showcases the flexibility of the language but also enhances one's fundamental understanding of programming concepts.
